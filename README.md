# 📈 IPO Subscription & Listing Gain Analysis using Python

## 📌 Project Overview

This project analyzes IPO subscription patterns and listing-day performance to identify the key factors that influence IPO success in the stock market. Using Python and exploratory data analysis, the project studies how investor participation, issue size, and market timing impact listing gains and investment risk.

The analysis provides data-driven insights useful for investors, analysts, and market participants to better understand IPO behavior and performance drivers.

## 🎯 Project Objectives

* Analyze IPO activity trends across months and years
* Study the relationship between subscription levels and listing gains
* Evaluate the impact of issue size on IPO performance
* Compare investor participation (QIB, HNI, RII) and its influence on returns
* Identify IPOs with negative listing gains to assess downside risk

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

* **Python** – Data analysis
* **Libraries:** Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn
* **Jupyter Notebook** – Analysis and visualization
* **Excel / CSV** – Dataset source

## 🔄 Methodology

1. Loaded IPO subscription and listing performance data using Pandas
2. Performed data validation to detect duplicates, missing values, and logical inconsistencies
3. Cleaned data using mean and business-rule-based imputation
4. Engineered features such as issue size buckets and time-based variables
5. Conducted exploratory data analysis using statistical summaries and visualizations
6. Analyzed correlations between investor demand and listing performance

## 📊 Key Analysis Performed

* Month-wise IPO activity and seasonal trends
* Issue size vs subscription and listing gain comparison
* Investor-wise subscription analysis (QIB, HNI, RII)
* Identification of highly subscribed and high-performing IPOs
* Risk analysis of IPOs with negative listing gains
* Correlation analysis between subscription intensity and returns

---

## 📈 Key Insights

* IPO activity shows clear seasonal and yearly patterns
* Higher subscription levels generally lead to better listing gains, though not guaranteed
* QIB and HNI participation show stronger correlation with listing performance than retail investors
* Mid-sized IPOs often provide better risk–return balance than very large issues
* A notable number of IPOs list at a loss, highlighting inherent investment risk

## ✅ Conclusion

The IPO market is active but selective. While strong investor demand improves listing performance, subscription alone does not guarantee success. Accurate pricing, issue size, investor mix, and market conditions collectively determine IPO outcomes. This project demonstrates how data analytics can support informed IPO investment decisions.
